# LabsAP
Labs for AP Computer Science.

These labs are from 2015.  I have not tested the repo yet to make sure that you can run the projects.

There are three projects.
* Magpie - a text-based chat bot
* pixLab - a picture editing exercise
* Elevens - a solitaire card game

Each of the labs has code and directions.  There are instructions in the files in the main repository.  The src folder has subfolders with the different folders in them.  Each of these folders may have subfolders too.

Just fork the repository and do the exercises.  At least that is what I hope is all you need to do.
